<h2> About </h2>
<hr>
<p>Boston Homemade Trade is a trading platform that allows user within your community to trade homemade goods and recipes with one another. Too many of us have a love for 
creating and sharing our homemade creations with one another, but currently there isn't any platform that exists that allows us to share foods and recipes with one another
besides pictures on social media. This website allows users to trade homemade dishes like pie, cake, bread, and other homemade creations, while getting to know other
like minded individuals in their neighborhood. We hope you use this site to meet others that are similar to you and learn other foods that are inspiring to make.</p>
